Research(for website):

Education: Write articles that people can read to learn about different topics such as phishing scams, two factor authentication, how to write a strong password, etc

What are phishing attacks?
A lot of people get phished because they don’t even know what phishing is and if they do, they don’t know how to prevent it. A typical phishing attack occurs when an unethical hacker tries to steal your sensitive information - passwords, credit card details, etc. - in order to steal your money. Many are easily trapped because they blindly click on insecure links that direct them to a login page, for example, where they are required to enter their username and/or password. The hacker then saves this information to use in the future in order to access the actual website with your credentials.

Example:
gmail.com -> update.gmail.com

Did you notice the difference? In this case, you should consider the update.google.com to be a malicious website because it has extra characters in its name you don’t see when visiting their website.

Another thing to note is that all secure websites begin with “https://” in their url. A way to check this is to hover over the link that you received in your gmail and see the url.

In this example, by hovering over the “MEMBERSHIP BONUS: $50 Cash Card for Filling Out Our 30-Second Survey,” we are able to see that the URL of the website does not begin with “https://”.

Social Engineering
Approximately 70-90% of cyberattacks utilize social engineering to get close to their next victim(got information from here). Through social engineering, a hacker can trace your digital footprint(information you leave behind when using the internet; examples include browsing history, online purchases, and Instagram posts). For example, if you have been looking for a company that can set up Christmas lights around your house, a scammer could identify this information and attempt to make you click on a link for a company that just happens to be in business for Christmas lights. By locating the Scam Detector on our website, you can ___(insert detailed information)



Strong Passwords(used this and this and this):

If you have managed to identify whether a website is secure by simply looking at the link, great job! Secure passwords are one of the most important things a user can control to prevent phishing attacks.  In order to improve the security of your passwords, many websites use a password manager to both generate random passwords that are not related to you in any way and save those passwords. You might have heard of “Google Password Manager” -  which is Google’s password manager that stores all your passwords for all the websites you used through your Google account.

Screencastify link showing Google Password Manager - I recorded it.

If you are using a Google account for all your websites, Google - through its password manager - gives you the option of choosing a random password when setting up your account. We highly recommend you do that because hackers can also steal your information through techniques such as password cracking(blindly guessing your password until the hacker cracks your password) and guessing(using personal information from social media to get the password). Creating a unique, strong, and complex password using a random password generator/recommendation will quickly eliminate the threat of the hacker from accessing your information. If, for some reason, a website that you want to create an account for does not provide you a random password to sign up, you can navigate to our random password generator(maybe link to our random password generator) in order to get a ___ digit unique code.
